SPBcal Program manual
---------------------


　We develop an algorithm called SPBcal under Java SE runtime environment 1.8.0_131 to calculate transport parameters of thermoelectric materials within the framework of single parabolic band (SPB) model.The following are some instructions, which contain a breif introduction to every files in the program, program Installation and program excution.

###*Program Introduciton###
　There are six files in the program named "FD0.java","FD.java","FD12.java","program5.java","otherdata.java" and "Main3.java".The first three file is to calculate Fermi-Dirac Integral zero,integer and half integer values."program5.java" is to determine reduced Fermi energy,"otherdata.java" is to calculate other ten related SPB transport parameters and "Main3.java" is to make integration of other files to build up Graphical interface.


###*Program Installation###
　 The program installation can divided into two parts: 1. install java JRE 　2.install SPBcal program.

　　1. Install java JRE

　　　　java JRE can be download here: [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre9-downloads-3848532.html)
　　　　

　　　　JRE download tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4c0YMtzxP0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4c0YMtzxP0) 

　　2. Install SPBcal program 

　　　　Once you see this README.md file, you must have downloaded the SPBcal.jar program, which is jsut beside REASME.md.

###*Program Excution###
   
　　1. Double click the SPBcal.jar, then you will see "How many temperature to calculate?".Enter a number within 1~20 and click "enter" button to generate input textfield.

　　2. Type at least Seebeck coefficient value (19~1464 uV/K) in the input textfield , then click "Calculate SPB transport parameters", the program will generate a table containing SPB parameters.
　　

　　3. Use "ctrl-C" and "ctrl-V" to copy the SPB transport paramters to Excel,then you can use these data for analyzing, comparing, plotting graph or some other uses.
